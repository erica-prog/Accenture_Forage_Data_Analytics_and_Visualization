# Accenture Forage Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation: Social Buzz Content Popularity Data Analysis 

This project simulates a real-world data analytics engagement with Accenture, in partnership with the fast-growing social media platform Social Buzz. The objective was to analyze the platform’s massive volume of user-generated content and determine the top-performing content categories based on aggregate popularity scores.

## Executive Summary

As part of a three-month simulated analytics initiative, the Accenture team was tasked with helping Social Buzz prepare for a successful IPO by leveraging its content engagement data. With over **100,000 pieces** of content generated daily, the platform faced challenges in identifying which themes or categories resonated most with its users.

Using exploratory data analysis and data modeling, this project identifies the **top 5 most popular content categories** across the platform, with a focus on user reactions, post frequency, and content scores. The final recommendations guide marketing strategy, brand partnerships, and campaign timing based on real-time engagement patterns.

## Business Challenge

**Problem Statement:**
Social Buzz’s content library exceeds 36 million posts per year. The company needed to understand which types of content drive the most engagement to inform monetization, brand deals, and campaign planning.

**Client Goal:**
Analyze historical engagement data to uncover the most popular categories of content, measured by aggregated reaction scores, and deliver business-ready insights for marketing and product strategy.
